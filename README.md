# CS 598 DL4H Learning from Sleep Data

In this proejct, We develop 4 neural network models for sleep scoring classification based on what we learned in CS 598 Deep learning course.

The project includes 5 files:
- Data Prep.ipynb : Prepare Data for neural network models
- 1D Modeling.ipynb : One Dimensional CNN model
- 2D Modeling.ipynb : Two Dimensional CNN model
- ResNet.ipynb : ResNet-18 convolutional neural network model
- 2D_Modeling_RCNN.ipynb : Two Dimensional RCNN (LSTM) model

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
For this study, we use publicly available PSG datasets from physionet repository [link](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/). For our study we use sleep cassette study data from this repository. This data has two sets of files namely the
*PSG.edf files and the *Hypnogram.edf files. You will need to download the files to your local 

# Usage
As the codes were developed in Google Collab, the easiest way to run the modes is to use Google Colab. Before run the modes in Google Colab, please save the previous files you downloaded to google drive. When you run the code in Google Collab, it will prompt you to mount your data folder in your Google drive.
