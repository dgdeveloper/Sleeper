# CS 598 DL4H Learning from Sleep Data

In this proejct, We develop 4 neural network models for sleep scoring classification based on what we learned in CS 598 Deep learning course.

The project includes 5 files:
- Data Prep.ipynb : Prepare Data for neural network models
- 1D Modeling.ipynb : One Dimensional CNN
- 2D Modeling.ipynb : Two Dimensional CNN
- ResNet.ipynb : ResNet-18 convolutional neural network 
- 2D_Modeling_RCNN.ipynb : Two Dimensional RCNN (LSTM)

#Getting Started
##Prerequisites
For this study, we use publicly available PSG datasets from physionet repository [link](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/). For our study we use sleep cassette study data from this repository. This data has two sets of files namely the
*PSG.edf files and the *Hypnogram.edf files. You will need to download the files to your local.

# Usage
As the codes were develope in Google Collab, the easiest way to run the modes is uing Google Collab. Before run the modes in Google Collab, please save the previou files you downloaded to google drive
